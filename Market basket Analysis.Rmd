# 🛒 Market Basket Analysis with R (Apriori & Eclat)

## 📌 Overview
This project applies **Market Basket Analysis (MBA)** on the **Groceries dataset** using R.  
The aim is to uncover **hidden item associations** that can be leveraged for:
- Cross-selling strategies  
- Personalized recommendations  
- Smarter store layouts

## ✨ Introduction
Ever noticed how online stores say *“Customers who bought bread also bought butter”*?  
That’s **Market Basket Analysis (MBA)** in action.  

Here, I used **Apriori** and **Eclat algorithms** in R to analyze **9,835 shopping transactions** and generate actionable insights for retailers.

## 📂 Steps in the Project

### 1️⃣ Load Data & Packages
library(arules)
library(arulesViz)
library(RColorBrewer)

data("Groceries")
9,835 transactions

169 unique items

Stored as a sparse transaction matrix

2️⃣ Explore the Dataset
Example Baskets:

Basket 1 → citrus fruit, semi-finished bread, margarine, ready soups

Basket 2 → tropical fruit, yogurt, coffee

Basket 3 → whole milk

📊 Top Items: whole milk, other vegetables, rolls/buns

3️⃣ Frequent Itemsets (Eclat)
r
Copy
Edit
F_I <- eclat(Groceries, parameter = list(supp=0.01, maxlen=10))
inspect(head(F_I, 10))
333 frequent itemsets (support ≥ 1%)

Example: {whole milk, yogurt} appears in 2.9% transactions

4️⃣ Item Frequency Visualization

itemFrequencyPlot(Groceries, topN=10, type="absolute", col="steelblue")
📝 Insight: Staple items (milk, bread, vegetables) dominate and co-occur often.

📌 Plots included:

frequent_item_plot
frequent_item_plot_apriori

5️⃣ Association Rules (Apriori)

rules <- apriori(Groceries, parameter = list(supp=0.002, conf=0.6))
summary(rules)
inspect(head(rules, 10))
Rules generated: 1098

Minimum Support = 0.2%

Minimum Confidence = 60%

6️⃣ Rule Metrics
Support → How often items occur together

Confidence → Probability of RHS given LHS

Lift → Strength of association ( >1 = strong )

Example:
{cereals} → {whole milk}
Support = 0.003
Confidence = 64%
Lift = 2.51
👉 Shoppers buying cereals are 2.5× more likely to buy whole milk.

7️⃣ Strongest Rules
Top Lift Rule:
{butter, hard cheese} → {whipped/sour cream}
Confidence = 51.2% | Lift = 7.15

Top Confidence Rule:
{citrus fruit, tropical fruit, root vegetables, whole milk} → {other vegetables}
Confidence = 88.5% | Lift = 4.57

8️⃣ Rule Visualization
Network Graph
plot(rules[1:10], method="graph", control=list(layout="circle"))
Highlights clusters around staples (milk, bread, vegetables).

Scatter Plot
plot(rules, method="scatterplot", measure=c("support","confidence"), shading="lift")
Shows distribution of rules across metrics.

📌 Plots included:

Network_Graph
Scatter_plot

🚀 Business Insights
Cross-Selling → Promote “rice + other vegetables” bundles

Store Layout → Place “baking powder” near “whole milk”

Personalized Offers → Suggest “whole milk” when shoppers buy “cereals”

📝 Conclusion
Market Basket Analysis with R (Eclat + Apriori) revealed strong product associations in the Groceries dataset.
Such insights help retailers in:

Recommendation Systems
Targeted Promotions
Optimized Store Layouts

This project demonstrates data-driven retail decision-making using R.
